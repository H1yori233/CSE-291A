# Phase 1 write-up 

## Evaluation Set

### Task 6
This task serves as a multi-app use case. It originates from some daily productivity use cases such as digitizing handwritten notes. It evaluates visual understanding (image-to-text), clipboard control, multi-application sequencing, and file export consistency. Besides, it also shows whether an agent can manage perception + action coherently.

### Task 10
This task is inspired by bilingual writing workflows. It combines copy/paste, window focus management reading comprehension, and assesses whether the agent can integrate tool use with semantic understanding.
